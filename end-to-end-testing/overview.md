# Overview

End-to-end testing is a methodology used to validate the flow and behavior of a system from start to finish. This type of testing aims to emulate real-world scenarios and user interactions, ensuring that all interconnected components of a system work together correctly. It is designed to ensure the comprehensive testing of all critical pathways. By simulating real user scenarios, end-to-end testing helps to expose potential issues in the interaction between different system components, uncovering problems that may not be detected with other types of testing, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the system.
