### **Cookie Policy**

Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. GuardianUI may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. GuardianUI does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.

We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.

### **External Links**

\
Our websites may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. If you follow a link to any of these external sites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to those third-party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.

### **Log-in Features**

\
We may allow you to sign up and log in using your Google account or Github account (“Third-party app”). If you sign up using a third-party app, you will be asked to share certain information from your respective account with us. This information is collected and processed by the third-party app provider under their respective privacy terms. You can control the information that we receive from the third-party app  using the privacy settings in your respective account.

### **Marketing**

\
Where permitted in our legitimate interest or with your prior consent where required by law, we will use your personal information for marketing and to provide you with promotional update communications by email about the GuardianUI Products. You can object to further marketing at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the end of all our marketing and promotional electronic communications to you, or by contacting us using the contact details set out at in the Your Choices and Your Rights sections of this Privacy Policy.

### **Security and Data Retention**

\
We take reasonable steps, including physical, technical, and organizational measures, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, and damage. Unfortunately, transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information submitted to us.\
Your personal information will be retained by GuardianUI for the duration of your account and may be retained for a period after this time as necessary and relevant to our legitimate interests, our terms of agreement with you and in accordance with applicable legal obligations. This may include retention necessary to meet our tax reporting requirements as well as time required to enforce the relevant terms of agreement or to identify, issue or resolve legal proceedings. We may further retain and use personal information as necessary, including by not limited to complying with our legal obligations (including in defense or pursuit of a legal claim), resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\
We may retain a record of your stated objection to the processing of your data, including in respect of an objection to receiving marketing communications, for the sole legitimate purpose of ensuring that we can continue to respect your wishes and not contact you further, during the term of your objection.

### International Data Transfers

The personal information we collect is stored and processed in the United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third parties.

We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.

Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.

### Your Rights

\
You may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, including the following:

* the right to access your personal information that we hold;
* the right to request that we update your personal information;
* the right to have your personal information deleted;
* the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal information where our processing is inappropriate;
* the right to object to the processing of your personal information;
* the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we are processing your personal information based on your prior consent; and
* the right to lodge a formal compliant with a competent supervisory authority.

### Children’s Personal Information

GuardianUI does not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit any personal information from children under the age of eighteen (18), nor are the Services directed to children under the age of eighteen (18). If you are under the age of eighteen (18), please do not use our Service or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to use our Service or provide personal information to us. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of eighteen (18) has provided personal information to GuardianUI or is otherwise included in our Services, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that personal information.

### Your Choices

\
Account Information\
Our customers may access, update, or change personal information they have provided by logging into the GuardianUI application or emailing us at support@guardianui.com.\
Subject to the terms of their agreements with us, Customers may deactivate their accounts by emailing us at support@guardianui.com, but note that we may retain certain personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or for legitimate business purposes, such as to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of personal information for a certain period.

### Do Not Track

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a web browser setting a user can set to request that web applications disable their tracking of that user. When the setting is turned on, the web browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services to stop tracking the user’s browsing activity. There is, however, no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators on how these signals should be interpreted. As a result, we do not currently commit to responding to web browser DNT signals on the GuardianUI Website. If you would like to learn more about DNT, please visit https://allaboutdnt.com/.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we make changes to it, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy.
