# Framework Roadmap

* Add transaction data verification within `gui.validateContractInteraction`
* Add the ability to make assertions around on-chain state like ERC20 balances and allowances
* Add interfaces for easier mocking of other common contract state
* Add interfaces for easier mocking of network requests and APIs, particularly Subgraphs
* Parallelize test runs without Anvil fork collisions
