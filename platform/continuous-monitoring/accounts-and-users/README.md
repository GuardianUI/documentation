# Accounts and Users

GuardianUI is organized into Workspaces and Users.&#x20;

## Workspaces&#x20;

Everything you do in GuardianUI takes place in a Workspace. It's your virtual home to organize activity â€” as just one person, together as a team, or across a company.&#x20;

Think of Workspaces like Notion where you may be a member of multiple workspaces for different use cases (e.g. ABC\_DAO, XYZ\_DAO, and Personal\_Project).

## Users

Users are individual accounts within a Workspace (e.g. team members).
