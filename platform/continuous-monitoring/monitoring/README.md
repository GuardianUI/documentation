# Monitoring

## Overview

GuardianUI's continuous monitoring solution provides real-time vulnerability detection for your dapp’s frontend.

* Simulate user interactions as frequently as every 5 minutes.
* Verify transactions point to the correct contracts
* Validate approvals give the correct addresses access to user funds
* Get notified immediately when there’s an issue.

## Why Should You Monitor Your Frontend?

Web3 apps still depend on web2 infrastructure - which leaves your dapp exposed to countless vulnerabilities and is impossible to constantly manually review.&#x20;

GuardianUI can continuously monitor your app for issues that cause your frontend to create the wrong smart contract interactions. This includes:

* DNS poisoning attacks&#x20;
* Cloudflare attacks&#x20;
* Javascript injections
* Malicious package injections&#x20;
* Malicious minifiers
* Package name squatting
* Compromised linters
* And more!

## Web3 Hack Examples

There are several examples of the types of frontend attacks our monitoring system would detect. In each of the examples below, bad actors were able to compromise vulnerabilities with a project’s frontend and steal money from users.&#x20;

* [BadgerDAO](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/02/badger-dao-protocol-suffers-10m-exploit/) (Cloudflare attack) - $120M in user funds stolen

* [Pancake Swap](https://decrypt.co/61431/pancakeswap-hacked) (DNS) - prompted users to enter seed phrase
