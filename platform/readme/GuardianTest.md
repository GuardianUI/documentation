# GuardianTest

GuardianTest is an open source E2E testing framework developed to suit the demands of crypto organizations and developers.

It extends the popular [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) testing framework so developers can easily:

* Engage with local deployments, staging deployments, OR live production
* Perform tests on EVM compatible chains
* Pin tests to any block
* Interact with a site using a wallet
* Mock ERC20 balances and allowances
* Validate target contract addresses from app interactions
* Perform any other actions or validation Playwright offers
