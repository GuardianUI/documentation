# Getting Started

* **Easy installation** - install GuardianTest through npm or yarn.&#x20;
* **No configuration or dependency hell** - just install the GuardianTest package. No need to worry about browser and wallet versions (e.g. Metamask).
* **Off-the-shelf everything** - test across any EVM-compatible chain, multiple browsers, multiple operating systems, multiple device types, multiple programming languages, and more.
* **All-in-one framework** - writing web3 end-to-end tests takes a lot of different tools to work together such as Playwright, Alchemy, Ethers, Foundry/Anvil, window.ethereum, Metamask/wallet extension, and more. With GuardianTest, weâ€™ve made everything work together seamlessly out of the box.
